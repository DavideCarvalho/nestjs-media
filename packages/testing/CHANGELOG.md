# @dudousxd/nestjs-media-testing

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#211](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-media/pull/211) [`8f3315e`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-media/commit/8f3315e3ba7c4825a51dbf413e1a9615a058312b) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - Require Node.js 24 or newer: `engines.node` is now `>=24` (was `>=20`, or unset). CI tests on Node 24 and 26. Upgrade Node, then the packages.

  **Breaking (`@dudousxd/nestjs-media-core`):** the `MediaDiagnosticEnvelope` type, kept only for code written against the old media-specific envelope, is removed. Type a message from an `aviary:media:<event>` channel as `DiagnosticEvent` from `@dudousxd/nestjs-diagnostics` (same shape). See the docs' Upgrading page.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#209](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-media/pull/209) [`d42f192`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-media/commit/d42f19226f93952584e162cef614d72a8960e967) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - Media follows the request's tenant from `@dudousxd/nestjs-context` (opt-in, off by default).

  - `MediaModule.forRoot({ tenancy })`: `'inherit'` (default, follows `ContextModule`'s `tenancy.enabled`), `false`, or `{ enabled, kinds, nullRows }`.
  - With tenancy on, `attach` and resumable uploads stamp the tenant (an explicit `tenantId` wins); `library.get/list/locate/url`, conversions, `MediaService.serve/url/delete`, upload sessions and the dashboard's library and uploads views apply the matching rule on top of `authorize`. A record or session of another tenant is not found (404), never 403.
  - Every store gains a nullable `tenant_id` (TypeORM, MikroORM, Drizzle sqlite/pg incl. upload sessions, the Prisma model docs) with an index, and `enableTenancy()`. With tenancy on and the column missing, the boot fails with `MediaTenancyUnavailableError` and the fix. With tenancy off, the column is never read or written.
  - Hidden or missing behaves the same: `library.delete()`, `MediaService.delete()` and upload `abort()` are a silent no-op. With tenancy on, the dashboard's delete record and cancel upload are a 404, whether the id belongs to another tenant or doesn't exist.
  - A store's `save` (and the Drizzle pg session store's `create`/`update`) returns the `tenantId` it persisted: none while tenancy is off. TypeORM writes the row and its tenant in one transaction.
  - New `library.get(id)`. Docs: the Tenancy page, with backfill SQL.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#199](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-media/pull/199) [`fa191a3`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-media/commit/fa191a3e7a982e71e23b8cdd9fd67deec3848437) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - **Breaking:** `InMemoryDriver` and `runStorageDriverConformance` are removed (use `InMemoryDisk` from `@nestjs/storage`). New `describeMediaDiskConformance(name, makeDisk, { multipart, prefix })` checks a `StorageDisk` (and optionally its multipart side-car) against what nestjs-media relies on; the repo runs it on `LocalDisk`, `InMemoryDisk` and `S3Disk` on MinIO. New `storageOf({ name: disk }, default?)` builds a `Storage` for unit tests. New peer `@nestjs/storage`.

### Patch Changes

- [#199](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-media/pull/199) [`fa191a3`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-media/commit/fa191a3e7a982e71e23b8cdd9fd67deec3848437) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - Fix packages that could be published without files their `exports` point to. The two tsup passes (ESM, CJS) no longer each clean `dist/` while running at the same time; `dist/` is cleaned once before the build. A new `check:exports` step (also `prepack`) fails the release if any `exports`/`main`/`types` path is missing.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- c03d5c7: Byte-range reads: `stream(path, { start, end })`, and a range-honouring `object/raw`.

  Every read in this library was all-or-nothing. `stream()` gave you the object from byte zero, so
  anything that wanted a slice — a file header, a footer, one page in the middle — had to transfer the
  whole object to reach it. For a thumbnail that is fine. For the 302 MB SQLite database or the 2 GB
  Parquet file someone dropped in a bucket, it means the console can either download it or show
  nothing, and it showed nothing.

  `StorageDriver.stream(path, range?)` now takes a `ReadRangeOptions { start, end? }` — both bounds
  inclusive, `end` omitted meaning "to EOF", the same convention as HTTP `Range`, because that is what
  it becomes at both ends of the wire. The S3 driver passes it through as `Range:` on `GetObject`; the
  local driver hands it to `createReadStream` (whose `end` is inclusive too, so no ±1); the in-memory
  test driver slices its buffer. The shared conformance suite gained cases for a mid-file range, a
  range running past EOF (clamps, never throws), and an open-ended one, so every driver has to agree.

  `DriverCapabilities.ranged` is **required**, not optional, and that is the breaking edge of this
  change: a third-party driver will stop compiling until it answers the question. That is the point. A
  driver that accepts the argument and quietly ignores it returns the whole object to a caller who
  asked for 64 KB, and the caller cannot tell — it just reads a few hundred megabytes believing it
  holds one page. A compile error is a much better way to find out than a memory spike in production.

  On the console side, `GET disks/:disk/object/raw` now speaks the protocol properly: `Accept-Ranges:
bytes` on every response, `206` with `Content-Range` and a sliced `Content-Length` for a satisfiable
  range, `416` with `Content-Range: bytes */<size>` for one that isn't, and a plain `200` — byte for
  byte what it served before — when there is no `Range` header or the header is malformed, per RFC 9110. `bytes=a-b`, `bytes=a-`, and the suffix form `bytes=-n` are all understood; a multi-range
  request is ignored rather than half-answered. A range against a disk whose driver reports
  `ranged: false` fails loudly instead of silently returning everything.

  The browser client gained `objectRange(disk, key, start, end)`. It throws when the server answers
  `200`, which is the entire reason it exists as a function rather than a `fetch` call at each call
  site: a reverse proxy that strips `Range` turns a 64 KB page read into a 302 MB one, and the failure
  would otherwise surface as a hang rather than an error.

## 0.5.10

### Patch Changes

- 36dd0b0: Stop the next `core` minor from publishing twelve packages as 1.0.0.

  Twelve packages declared their peer dependency on `@dudousxd/nestjs-media-core` as `workspace:*`. Changesets treats a peer bump as breaking for the dependent, and "breaking" on a `0.x` package means `1.0.0` — so the first minor `core` takes would promote the entire repo at once, with no `major` changeset anywhere in sight.

  This has not fired yet only because `core` has not taken a minor recently. The identical bug did fire in `nestjs-agent`, where six packages were queued to publish as `1.0.0` off a routine SPI change and were caught in the release PR.

  Ranges are now `>=0.8.0 <1.0.0`. `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange` is already set in the changesets config; it just needs a range a `0.9.0` core still satisfies.

  Verified by simulation rather than argument: adding a throwaway `core: minor` changeset and running `changeset version` produces twelve `1.0.0` bumps before this change and zero after — `core` goes to `0.9.0` and every dependent stays on a patch.

  `workspace:*` in `dependencies` is left alone; it is resolved at publish and causes none of this. Only peers matter.

## 0.5.7

### Patch Changes

- 9901000: Add `@dudousxd/nestjs-media-dashboard` — a standalone, navigable `/media` console.

  A self-mounting React SPA + JSON API (like `@dudousxd/nestjs-durable-dashboard`) for browsing storage disks and their object tree, watching live resumable uploads, and browsing the media library by collection with variant thumbnails. Mount with `MediaDashboardModule.forRoot({ basePath, apiBasePath, actions })`; depends only on `-core` and resolves the media tokens by value, degrading to empty shapes when a `MediaStore`/upload store is absent (never throws). Destructive actions (delete/copy/move object, delete record, cancel session) are gated behind `actions: true` (default off). No built-in auth — the host guards the mount.

  Note on "Cancel session": it removes the resumable session record from the upload store (so it stops showing as in-progress) but does NOT tear down an underlying native multipart upload — the decoupled console resolves only the `UploadSessionStore`, not the `ResumableUploadManager` that owns `abort()`. An incomplete multipart is reaped by the bucket lifecycle policy.

  Supporting SPI added to enable the console (all optional/additive — non-breaking):

  - **core**: `MediaStore.list?(filter, page)` — paginated global record listing with an opaque `(createdAt, id)` keyset cursor (`MediaListFilter`/`MediaListPage`/`MediaListResult`); `UploadSession.createdAt?` for upload age.
  - **database adapters** (mikro-orm, typeorm, prisma, drizzle): implement `list()` with a `(collection, createdAt, id)` index. For already-deployed tables add a manual `CREATE INDEX` migration.
  - **upload-redis / testing**: set `createdAt` on session create; in-memory `MediaStore.list()`.

- Updated dependencies [9901000]
  - @dudousxd/nestjs-media-core@0.6.7

## 0.5.6

### Patch Changes

- 70cba69: Add a Telescope media dashboard (`mediaTelescopeExtension()`) plus the SPI it needs.

  - **core**: optional `list?()` on `ResumableUploadManager` (`UploadSessionListFilter`); optional `count?()`/`aggregate?()` on `MediaStore` (`MediaCountFilter`, `MediaAggregateQuery`, `MediaAggregateBucket`, `MediaAggregateResult`). All additions are optional — no breaking changes.
  - **nestjs**: export `MEDIA_STORE`, `MEDIA_UPLOAD_SESSIONS`, `MEDIA_STORAGE_SHARED` DI tokens; wire the shared storage alias.
  - **telescope**: new `mediaTelescopeExtension()` declarative extension — a `media.overview` dashboard with 12 data providers (in-progress uploads, active count, success rate, uploads/throughput over time, recent uploads, library totals, by-collection, storage-by-disk, storage writes over time, attachment activity, disks). Every provider degrades to an empty shape when the media module or an optional SPI method is absent (never throws).
  - **database adapters** (mikro-orm, typeorm, prisma, drizzle): implement `count()`/`aggregate()` with supporting indexes. MikroORM uses a raw connection query with quoted aliases to avoid Postgres case-folding zeroing the aggregate sums.
  - **testing / upload-redis**: in-memory + Redis implementations of the new SPI methods.

  > Note: the new adapter indexes are created automatically for fresh tables. For already-deployed media tables, add a manual `CREATE INDEX` migration (see each adapter's index definition).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 05af5b4: Add presigned S3 multipart direct uploads (DirectUploadManager + MultipartUploadDriver surface + MediaDirectUploadController + MediaModule.direct option) and a Redis UploadSessionStore adapter (@dudousxd/nestjs-media-upload-redis) for multi-replica resumable proxy uploads. Both modes selectable via uploadMode.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [05af5b4]
  - @dudousxd/nestjs-media-core@0.5.0

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- be47230: Media diagnostics now publish through `@dudousxd/nestjs-diagnostics` (`aviary:media:*`), so any app using `@dudousxd/nestjs-diagnostics-telescope`'s generic watcher auto-captures media events (upload/attach/conversion/delete) with zero per-lib wiring. The standalone `MediaWatcher` is superseded by that bridge but kept for standalone use.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [be47230]
  - @dudousxd/nestjs-media-core@0.4.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 99777bb: Add a driver-agnostic `list(prefix, options?)` to the `StorageDriver` contract (returns `{ folders, files, cursor? }`), implemented for the S3 (ListObjectsV2 with optional bucket override), local (readdir), and in-memory drivers, plus a `list` capability flag. The S3 `list` honours `options.bucket` for admin cross-bucket browsing. The MikroORM database adapter now supports MikroORM 7 (peer `^6 || ^7`).
