# @dudousxd/nestjs-media-dashboard

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9901000: Add `@dudousxd/nestjs-media-dashboard` — a standalone, navigable `/media` console.

  A self-mounting React SPA + JSON API (like `@dudousxd/nestjs-durable-dashboard`) for browsing storage disks and their object tree, watching live resumable uploads, and browsing the media library by collection with variant thumbnails. Mount with `MediaDashboardModule.forRoot({ basePath, apiBasePath, actions })`; depends only on `-core` and resolves the media tokens by value, degrading to empty shapes when a `MediaStore`/upload store is absent (never throws). Destructive actions (delete/copy/move object, delete record, cancel session) are gated behind `actions: true` (default off). No built-in auth — the host guards the mount.

  Note on "Cancel session": it removes the resumable session record from the upload store (so it stops showing as in-progress) but does NOT tear down an underlying native multipart upload — the decoupled console resolves only the `UploadSessionStore`, not the `ResumableUploadManager` that owns `abort()`. An incomplete multipart is reaped by the bucket lifecycle policy.

  Supporting SPI added to enable the console (all optional/additive — non-breaking):

  - **core**: `MediaStore.list?(filter, page)` — paginated global record listing with an opaque `(createdAt, id)` keyset cursor (`MediaListFilter`/`MediaListPage`/`MediaListResult`); `UploadSession.createdAt?` for upload age.
  - **database adapters** (mikro-orm, typeorm, prisma, drizzle): implement `list()` with a `(collection, createdAt, id)` index. For already-deployed tables add a manual `CREATE INDEX` migration.
  - **upload-redis / testing**: set `createdAt` on session create; in-memory `MediaStore.list()`.
